# shadcn-installer

This project was created to improve [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) monorepo support. The standard [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) has limitations when working with monorepo structures, making it difficult to install and manage components across multiple packages. This installer aims to provide enhanced tooling that better handles monorepo configurations, workspace dependencies, and component installation in complex project structures.
